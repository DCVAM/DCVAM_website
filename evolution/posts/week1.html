        <h1>Week 1: The Origins of Control Theory</h1>
        <p>Control theory has been a crucial part of engineering and automation since the early days of machinery. From ancient water clocks to modern drone stabilization systems, control systems help maintain stability and precision.</p>

        <h2>Early Examples of Control Systems</h2>
        <p>One of the earliest examples of feedback control was the **centrifugal governor**, developed by James Watt in the 18th century. This device automatically regulated steam engines by adjusting fuel input.</p>
        <img src="../../layouts/assets/images/governor.jpg" alt="Centrifugal Governor">

        <h2>Mathematical Foundations</h2>
        <p>Control systems are often modeled using differential equations. The basic feedback loop can be represented as:</p>
        <p>$$ G(s) = \frac{K}{s + a} $$</p>
        <p>where \( G(s) \) is the transfer function, \( K \) is the system gain, and \( a \) is the damping factor.</p>

        <h2>Impact on Drone Control</h2>
        <p>Modern drones rely on **PID controllers** (Proportional-Integral-Derivative controllers) to stabilize their flight and respond to external disturbances effectively.</p>
